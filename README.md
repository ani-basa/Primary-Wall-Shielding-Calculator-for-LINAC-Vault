README for Linac Vault Shielding Calculator

Overview

The Linac Vault Shielding Calculator is a tool designed to assist in calculating the total barrier thickness, barrier transmission factor, and required TVLs (Tenth Value Layers) for primary walls based on user-provided inputs.

Note: This tool should be used strictly for research purposes or secondary verification and should not replace professional shielding calculations or regulatory compliance assessments.

User Inputs

To ensure accurate results, please provide the following inputs:
	1.	Area Type
	•	Example: Controlled Area (0.1 mSv/week)
	2.	Shielding Material
	•	Example: Concrete, Lead, etc.
	3.	Machine Energy (MV)
	•	Example: 6 MV, 10 MV, 15 MV, etc.
	4.	Gantry Angle Interval (U)
	•	Example: 90-degree interval
	5.	Gantry Angle (θ)
	•	Example: 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, etc.
	6.	Distance to Point of Interest (d_Pr) in meters
	•	Example: 3.2 meters
	7.	Workload (W) in Gy/week
	•	Example: 450 Gy/week
	8.	Occupancy Factor (T)
	•	Example: Full occupancy areas (T = 1), partial occupancy areas (T < 1)

How to Use the Calculator
	1.	Ensure that the Notepad file and the .html file are stored in the same folder for proper execution.
	2.	Open the HTML file in a web browser.
	3.	Enter the required shielding parameters into the respective input fields.
	4.	Click the “Calculate” button to generate results.
	5.	The output will include:
	•	Total barrier thickness
	•	Barrier transmission factor
	•	Number of TVLs required
	6.	Use the results as a reference or for further verification.
